# mongodb-course

Please use this as a reference guide only.
I am writing this up as a part of my homework assignments. And thought I would share it to others as a reference manual. 

This repository is used to find and navigate homeworks for the
MongoDB coursework - M101J : MongoDB for Java Developers.

Most homeworks have pom.xml for you to build.

Please find step by step answers to all other homeworks (non-code-based) in my Evernote notebook:

Enjoy!
