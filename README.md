Please use this as a reference guide only.
<BR><BR>
I am writing this up as a part of my homework assignments. And thought I would share it to others as a reference manual. 
<BR><BR>

This repository is used to find and navigate homeworks for the
<BR>
<B>MongoDB coursework - M101J : MongoDB for Java Developers.</B>
<BR><BR>

<I>Most homeworks have pom.xml for you to build.</I>
<BR><BR>

Please find step by step answers to all other homeworks (non-code-based) in my Evernote notebook:
https://www.evernote.com/pub/bhuleskar/mongodb
<BR><BR><BR>

Enjoy!
